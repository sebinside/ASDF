We use badges to indicate the current state of a module, as well as its authors / concept origin, and programming language used.

Regarding the state of a module, we distinguish between the following states:

| State      | Description                       |
|------------|-----------------------------------|

| ![State](https://img.shields.io/badge/state-stable-green) | The module is mature and can be used in production |
| ![State](https://img.shields.io/badge/state-deprecated-red) | The module is no longer maintained |
