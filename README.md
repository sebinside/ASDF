[Elgato Stream Decks](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/s/explore-stream-deck) are, without a doubt, powerful hardware (and software!) controllers for streamers, content creators, developers, and anyone looking to enhance their productivity. However, there is *always* room for improvement. This is **ASDF**, a collection of advanced stream deck features. This project has three main goals:

**💪 Empower power users**: Provide advanced features and customization options for really experienced users (like me 🤓).

**🛠️ Bend the boundaries**: Push the limits of what the Stream Deck can do, exploring new possibilities and functionalities.

**🌟 Be an inspiration**: Some features may inspire the community and also the software developers over at Elgato 😉

## Modules

This project is split up in modules that can be used independently. Each module has its own folder and a README file explaining its purpose, installation instructions, and usage. Modules have a lifecycle as marked by [badges](BADGES.md).

Since Stream Deck software 6.9, it is possible to paste an icon from the clipboard. However, there is no shortcut to do so. This module adds the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+V` to paste an icon from the clipboard.
